const aboutContent = `Aviaco is a PART 145 workshop specialised in dismantling and the distribution of Airbus helicopter spare parts. Once the aircraft has been dismantled in our workshop, the parts are recertified and sold throughout the world. These spare parts and sub-assemblies are delivered by their quality and airworthiness documents. We operate from our premises in the south of France in Marignane.

Aviaco benefits from an international network established throughout the world to sell their spare parts. We place our workforce in the satisfaction of our customers. Thanks to a close collaboration with our suppliers, we offer a complimentary service to those offered by the OEMs. We optimise costs and processing times. We constantly renew our services.

We are fully aware that our business is based on the trust we share with our customers, based on our services. It is with this objective in mind that we seek to satisfy all your requests in full transparency. The proper functioning of our quality system is verified by independent auditors.

Our activity is part of a circular economy and a sustainable environmental vision.`;
